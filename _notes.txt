error handling on the client for requests that don't make it/get rejected
roll-log todos
3d stuff
whatever else is in the roadmap
polish

Minor snag,
- Add error handling, but useMutation hook's onError callback never gets reached
- Seems like the browser was holding back the request in a `Stalled` state if the server was down
- Apollo never interpreted that as an error, so we'd just be locked 
- Solution: manually implement timeouts

Major snag, fixed by e48bc33:
- Needed to change server.ts to explicitly define a websocket server to handle requests against `ws://localhost:4000/dice/graphql`
- Apollo documentation at https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions was out of date
- Documentation shows `import { useServer } from 'graphql-ws/lib/use/ws';`
- Correct import in graphql v6 is `import { useServer } from 'graphql-ws/use/ws';` (per https://the-guild.dev/graphql/ws/recipes)
- Apollo has the latest graphql as a dependency. So doc examples just don't actually work.
- Imagine having to go check the graphql documentation. This was actually me. I had to. All the king's AIs and all the king's client documentation couldn't put my imports back together again.
