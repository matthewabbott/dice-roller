# Canvas Integration Roadmap: TTRPG Dice Roller

## **🎯 PROJECT STATUS: Canvas Front-and-Center Implementation COMPLETE**

**Current Reality**: Square canvas with left sidebar, clear dice terminology, streamlined controls  
**Your Primary Aims**: ✅ COMPLETE - Canvas-focused layout with professional UX patterns

---

## **✅ COMPLETED FEATURES**

### **Sprint 1 - Core Virtual Dice Implementation: ✅ COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Virtual Dice Canvas Integration**: Large rolls (>20 dice) spawn as virtual dice
- ✅ **Floating Result Numbers**: Physical dice show floating overlays when settling
- ✅ **Result Synchronization**: Chat results perfectly synced with canvas results
- ✅ **Group Sum Display**: Multiple dice from same roll show group total
- ✅ **No Console Spam**: Clean overlay system with proper state management

### **Sprint 2 - Canvas Front-and-Center Layout: ✅ COMPLETE**

#### **2.1: Canvas-First Layout Restructure** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Make canvas the primary focus with better proportions

**Implemented Layout Structure**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header                              │
├─────────────┬───────────────────────┤
│ Left Sidebar│ Right Side (60%)      │
│ (40%)       │                       │
│ - Activity  │ ┌─────────────────────┤
│ - Lobby     │ │ Square Canvas       │
│ - Chat      │ │ (Primary Focus)     │
│             │ └─────────────────────┤
│             │ Controls Panel        │
│             │ - User Settings       │
│             │ - Quick Roll Commands │
└─────────────┴───────────────────────┘
```

**✅ Completed**:
- **Modified**: `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Complete restructure to sidebar layout
- **Responsive**: Square canvas with proper aspect ratio
- **Balanced**: 40% sidebar, 60% canvas area for better proportions

#### **2.2: Enhanced Dice Controls Terminology** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Clear distinction between local and remote dice

**✅ Completed**:
- **Clarified Terminology**: "Quick Roll Commands" generate shared dice via `/roll` commands
- **Professional Styling**: Blue theme for shared dice commands
- **Clear Labeling**: "Shared Dice" badge instead of "Testing Only"
- **Accurate Tooltips**: Explains that commands create dice visible to all players

#### **2.3: Streamlined Canvas Controls** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Remove misleading controls from canvas overlay

**✅ Completed**:
- **Removed**: "Roll All Dice" and "Clear All" buttons from canvas overlay
- **Focused**: Canvas overlay now only shows camera and view controls
- **Updated Hotkeys**: Removed R, C, T hotkeys (local dice operations)
- **Kept**: Space (camera lock), F (fullscreen), V (reset camera), Esc (unfocus)

#### **2.4: Expandable Chat Sections** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Better organization of chat area with expandable sections

**✅ Completed**:
- **Expandable Lobby**: Shows active players with colors and online status
- **Expandable Activity Feed**: Organized with filter controls
- **CollapsibleSection Component**: Reusable component for UI organization
- **Default Expanded**: Both sections start expanded for immediate access

#### **2.5: Warning Colors for Incomplete Rolls** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Change incomplete /roll tooltips from error red to warning orange/yellow

**✅ Completed**:
- **Updated ChatInput.tsx**: Changed error styling to warning colors
- **Consistent Styling**: Orange borders, backgrounds, and text for incomplete commands
- **Better UX**: "Warning:" instead of "Error:" for incomplete commands

---

## **🎯 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

### **Key Changes Made**:

#### **Layout Restructure**:
- **Square Canvas**: Proper aspect ratio with max-width constraint
- **Left Sidebar**: 40% width for chat, lobby, and activity feed
- **Right Panel**: 60% width with canvas and controls
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

#### **Dice Terminology Clarification**:
- **Local Dice**: Physics dice in canvas (controlled by DiceControlPanel)
- **Remote Dice**: Shared dice from `/roll` commands (visible to all players)
- **Quick Roll Commands**: Buttons that generate `/roll` commands for shared dice
- **Canvas Controls**: Only camera and view operations (no dice operations)

#### **Streamlined Controls**:
- **Canvas Overlay**: Camera lock, fullscreen, reset camera only
- **Global Hotkeys**: Space, F, V, Esc (camera/view operations only)
- **Local Dice Controls**: Remain in DiceControlPanel (not in canvas overlay)
- **Shared Dice Commands**: Clear labeling and professional styling

#### **Enhanced Organization**:
- **CollapsibleSection**: Reusable component for organizing UI
- **Expandable Lobby**: User list with colors and status
- **Activity Feed**: Organized with filters and expandable sections
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent blue theme for shared operations

## **📊 SUCCESS METRICS - ALL ACHIEVED**

### **Sprint 2 Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Canvas is square and properly proportioned as primary focus
- ✅ Clear distinction between local dice (canvas physics) and remote dice (shared)
- ✅ Canvas overlay only shows camera/view controls (no misleading dice controls)
- ✅ Quick roll commands clearly labeled as creating shared dice
- ✅ Hotkeys focused on camera operations (Space, F, V, Esc)
- ✅ Chat has expandable lobby and activity controls sections
- ✅ Incomplete /roll commands show orange/yellow warnings instead of red errors
- ✅ Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- ✅ Professional UI with consistent styling and clear labeling

### **User Experience Goals - ACHIEVED**:
- **Balanced Focus**: Canvas is primary but not overwhelming (60% vs 40% split)
- **Clear Terminology**: Local vs. shared dice distinction is crystal clear
- **Streamlined Controls**: No confusing or misleading buttons on canvas
- **Professional Polish**: Consistent styling and proper labeling throughout
- **Efficient Workflow**: Hotkeys for common camera operations, quick roll commands for shared dice

## **🚀 NEXT PHASE OPPORTUNITIES**

### **Potential Future Enhancements**:
1. **Advanced Camera Controls**: Save/load camera positions, preset views
2. **Enhanced Dice Grouping**: Select multiple dice for group operations
3. **Improved Physics Settings**: Gravity, bounce, material settings
4. **Visual Effects**: Particle effects, enhanced lighting controls
5. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch controls, responsive canvas interactions

src/components/
├── Layout.tsx                    # ✅ Restructured to sidebar layout
├── ChatInput.tsx                 # ✅ Warning colors for incomplete commands
├── DiceRoller.tsx               # ✅ Clear shared dice terminology
├── ActivityFeed.tsx             # ✅ Expandable sections with CollapsibleSection
├── DiceCanvas.tsx               # ✅ Streamlined hotkeys and canvas controls
└── controls/
    ├── CanvasOverlay.tsx        # ✅ Removed dice controls, camera only

```

### **Hooks Modified**:
```
src/hooks/
└── useGlobalHotkeys.ts          # ✅ Streamlined to camera/view controls only

### **Key Design Decisions**:
- **Square Canvas**: Better proportions than full-width rectangle
- **Sidebar Layout**: More traditional and balanced than bottom panel
- **Terminology Clarity**: "Local" vs "Remote" vs "Shared" dice clearly distinguished
- **Control Separation**: Canvas overlay for view, panels for dice operations
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent blue theme for shared operations

---

**Bottom Line**: The canvas front-and-center implementation is complete with a balanced, professional layout that clearly distinguishes between local canvas physics and shared multiplayer dice. The interface is streamlined, terminology is clear, and controls are logically organized.
